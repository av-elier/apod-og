I wanted to have a slack reminder to embed astronomic picture of the day. Sadly, https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ have no open graph tags and is bad at embedding as image. So, why not to add og tags?

On second thought, why not redirect temporarily to the image path of the photo at original site, if jpg embeds perfectly?

So here is a micro project. [Hosted](https://apog-og.herokuapp.com/304) on free heroky dyno, added to daily reminder. Beautiful sky!
